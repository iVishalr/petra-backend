Cons: TV DTH was not recharged. No Microwave as stated. Blankets had hairs on it.Had to use personal bedsheets and blankets. Air conditioning was not working on the check out day morning. There was sound of maintainence whole time we stayed there, which was very annoying. Breakfast was not provided even though many restaurants were open already. There is no balcony in the room as stated."
