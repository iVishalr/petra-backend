However, above and beyond my expectations was the hospitality of the staff who had the 'can-do' attitudes and made me feel welcome to ask for assistance.I never actually felt quite sad having to leave a hotel like when I had to leave Park Hyatt Chennai, and I've traveled extensively. It's the people who made this hotel truly exceptional."
