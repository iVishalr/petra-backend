We asked for an extra bed which was set up immediately. Housekeeping was very thorough everyday. Service during breakfast was a bit sloppy maybe because of the sheer number of guests. Everyday we were seated at tables that didn't have a fully service of crockery and cutlery. Every diner was given their own plastic bottle of water which i didn't understand. So eco unfriendly!! The breakfast buffet was quite extensive. The grounds of the hotel are impeccable and the beach is for the most part clean."
