## How to run?

In the root directory, type `mongod` in your terminal. This will start a local mongo server.

Then,

Now we must install the dependencies for the backend server to run.

In terminal, type `npm i` to install them.

In terminal type `nodemon index.js` to start the backend server.

*Note : Do not start the backend server without starting a local mongo server. It will throw an error!
Also, I have assumed that you have mongoDB installed locally. If not please intall it before you proceed.*
